# The Silence Before the Server Farm

To quote Kurt Vonnegut..."So it goes."

Microsoft wants to pave 244 acres of Wisconsin farmland for a data center. Forty of forty-nine people who spoke at the planning meeting said **"No!** They were not confused. They were not dazzled. They looked at the thing squarely and said: **Not Here!**

The Quakers have a phrase: *way opens*. It means you wait in the silence until clarity arrives unbidden. You do not force the door. The farmers and retirees of Caledonia sat in their own kind of meeting for worship. They considered the offer—a few jobs, some tax revenue, the privilege of hosting machines that guess the next word—and the way did not open. Four to nothing.

Why are we all acquiescing to technology? Consider what Wisconsin has already given. The state lost twenty-two percent of its manufacturing jobs since the turn of the century. The factories closed. The jobs went overseas. Now the tech companies arrive with a fresh promise: we will fill that void. We will be your future. But the residents of Caledonia looked at Microsoft's proposal and saw the same extraction wearing new clothes. A former sheriff's lieutenant in nearby Vienna worried it would be like the dot-com bubble all over again. He has seen promises before.

What are we doing to the land for this? The utility buried coal ash on this same ground decades ago. Molybdenum leached into private wells. They bought a hundred acres as a buffer around the wound. Now Microsoft wants the land next door. The pattern repeats: take what you need, leave what you must, call it progress. We call it artificial intelligence, but there is nothing intelligent about paving topsoil for pattern-matching machines. Prediction is not thought. Correlation is not wisdom.

The manipulation runs deep. They spend eighty billion dollars a year building these temples, then ask small towns to worship. In Port Washington, over a thousand people signed a petition demanding voter approval before the city could give away ten million in tax deals to OpenAI and Oracle. The people see a company worth trillions asking for subsidies from communities that cannot fix their own roads.

The testimony of simplicity asks: what is enough? The testimony of integrity asks: who truly benefits when the servers hum? The testimony of earthcare asks: what do we owe the land that held us before the factories, before the coal ash, before the data centers?

In Caledonia, forty-nine people saw clearly. Most said no. This is the oldest technology we have—people in a room, speaking truth, refusing to be sold a future they did not choose. Sometimes the silence holds. Sometimes the most radical act is to sit still and say: not here, not this, not us.
