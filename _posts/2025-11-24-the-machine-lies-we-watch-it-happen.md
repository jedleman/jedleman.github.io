## The Machine Lies and We Watch It Happen
Deepfakes flicker. Frame 30—that's where the mask slipped. The journalist's skin rippled like water for one-thirtieth of a second. Half a million people missed it. They saw what they wanted: a woman dancing. Proof.
Bullshit. The body belonged to an Indian actress. The face was stolen. They wanted her reputation. They got it.

### What happens to the soul when the eyes can no longer be trusted?
We evolved to believe what we see. Our survival depended on this. Now they've poisoned the well.
In Pakistan they're manufacturing synthetic humans at scale. Free technology. Unchanging motivation: money, power, cruelty. Name tags reading "PRMRACCH"—AI hallucinating gibberish. Hands melting into other hands. American accents in Pakistani deserts.
Most people don't look closely. They scroll fast, react faster.
The attention economy runs on rage, not accuracy.

The investigator exposing these fakes used free tools. Five minutes. That's what it took to prove the lies. But patience doesn't scale.
So we train ourselves in cynicism instead. If everything might be fake, nothing matters. This isn't wisdom. This is surrender.

The Quakers say there is that of God in everyone. Every human face is sacred. You cannot steal someone's likeness and puppet it through degradation without committing murder of the soul.
The deepfakers know this. That's why they do it.
They issued pious apologies—fear of slander before God—and left the videos online. Sacred language shielding the profane.

There is a spiritual discipline available: Stop. Look closely. Resist the dopamine hit. Slow down enough to see the flicker.
This is prayer for the digital age. Not begging but attention. The radical act of caring whether something is true.
The tools exist. What matters is the choice to look, to verify, to refuse easy lies even when they confirm what we believe.
The alternative is a world where reality becomes negotiable. The technology isn't coming. It's here.

The ground beneath our feet is only as solid as our commitment to truth. When images lie, we lose orientation. We lose each other.
But ghosts can be unmasked. Frame 30. The flicker. The impossible silence. The evidence is there if we choose to look.
If we choose.
The tools are free. The methods simple. What's required is the oldest spiritual practice: attention. Patience. The willingness to see.
The machine lies and we watch it happen.
Sometimes, if we're paying attention, we catch it in the act.
