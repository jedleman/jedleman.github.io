# We build things that dont matter and we know it

The work of creating software is hard. Add personal craft expectations on top, it becomes increasingly difficult.  Then there are the customers.  The problem is complex and addictive.  I live for turning team and scope chaos into clean lines and quality software. I guess, as I age, what matters more to me is crafting projects and high performance teams. My hope is those things matter more than what we build. And therefore, I have found new meaning.

## How many systems have you built that no longer exist?
Blood, sweat, and curses over an over again. I huffed and puffed and stressed out and left jobs in frustration.  What for?  Most of my system development has been religated to the trash can.  And, that numer increases as the years go by and eventually a number is hit where you question your lifes work. For me, that number is under 10.  But, I do know there are many smaller others. Perhaps a total of 20.  Here are the bigger ones that took 6 months - muti-year engineering/maintenance:

1. PowerMan - The coolest at the time.  An end to end manufacturing system to replace piece cards.  It used KANBAN and tracked inventory and indirect labor across work cells.  My first taste of KANBAN BEFORE it was adopted by the Agilistas. I cut my developer teeth on this project.  But, most of the team was remote while I was in Indiana on the shop floor.
2. MK Cost Management & Help Desk Implementation - One of the most boring projects.  Managing civil engineering project cost tracking.  But, setting up the corporate help desk from Software selection to staffing and managing.  That was fun.  
3. Homer - A blast.  Largest team I had worked with up to that point in my career.  Architecturally, a mess.  Some of the most complicated code I had worked on.  All Claims adjudication logic. 
4. PDOE - An internal developer political clique and I was delighted to move on as a business analyst and project manager so that I could travel to all the cool mine sites and manufacturing locations across the United States.  I got to take tons of cool photos, meet great people, and got to be the voice of the internal customer.  
5. CCJC - A crazy troubled project I inherited.  So needed, they paid for me to move home from Arizona to manage it full time in person. Riddled with local government politics, contempt of court threats, and in the end, fun as hell.
6. Custom Jewelery System - Months of UX, design, conversations, and architecture.  Busted this out super fast. Showed it off to the entire country of retail managers.  I left the company and the tools never saw the light of day.
7. Shop Inventory - A Director wanted his choice for ERP and then cursed it from purchase to implementation.  I lost hair, friends, and learned that it was replaced a few years back.  Best thing for it really.  It was a poor choice for the company.  But, that guy would never admit it - even today.

## Have you ever returned to a place you worked and still found it sputtering along years later?
My record is 12 years.  CCJC - a local government IT organization still has, to this day, my software running.  It needed some care and feeding recently and they hired me to help out. 6 leaders that were originally where part of the project retired. That's how old.

The other occurance was when I returned to the jewelry company because they wanted me to resurect the custom jewelry projects that were iced 9 years earlier.  So, I got to work, and then they laid me off because they iced it again.  I won't be back.
## What does it mean to have your work matter?
You have to do this shit for yourself.  For the personal challenge of it all.  If you do it to leave a legacy, that just does not exist in most IT jobs unless you are someone like Jobs.  You have to find personal meaning because you will be treated terribly over time and it will become increasingly easy to begin to think none of it matters.
