## The Contemplative Project Manager: What Morning Silence Teaches About Leading Complex Programs

The alarm goes off at 5:47 AM because I am the kind of person who sets alarms for 5:47 instead of 5:45, which tells you something about how my brain works, or worked, before the Adderall. I don't spring from bed with spiritual eagerness. I shuffle to a couch in the the back of the house facing out to our wooded backyard and I sit. 

No phone. No list. No planner riddled with undone tasks. Just silence. Just sitting. Just the practice of waiting for something I cannot manufacture or project-manage into existence. Quakers call this "centering down." I call it the only hour of my day when I'm not trying to fix something that was broken before I got there.

### What Silence Actually Is
Silence is not the absence of noise. Cleveland wakes up around me—garbage trucks, early commuters, the neighbor's dog who has opinions about deer and squirrel lounging around his yard. Silence is the practice of not adding to it. Not narrating. Not strategizing. Not running through the list of action items from yesterday's stand-up where that slack developer still hasn't updated the angular ticket and the CIO wants to plan for everything even though we know little.

You sit. You breathe. You notice when your mind starts project-managing God.
Because it will. My mind, given seventeen seconds of unstructured time, will immediately begin organizing the divine into what he should be doing for the next sprint.

### The Problem with Managing Everything
I manage projects for whomever. Mostly, the kind of technical transformations where you inherit everyone else's architectural decisions and get blamed for the consequences. There are dependencies. There are blockers. There are stand-ups where key people get pulled into other project meetings, and planning boards that look clean until you realize Phase 1 intake isn't properly tagged. Before I started sitting in silence every morning, I believed my job was to control this chaos. To document it into submission. To framework it until it made sense. To over intellecualize it.

The silence teaches something different: you cannot control what you did not create. Sometimes you cannot even control what you create (But, that is a topic for another time). You can steward it. You can witness it. You can show up with integrity and make the next right decision. But the notion that a project manager "controls" a multi-workstream program with legacy dependencies and distributed teams is a beautiful, exhausting lie we tell ourselves so we can sleep at night.
I learned this at 5:47 AM, sitting in a chair that faces my hickory.  

### The Discipline of Not Knowing
In silence, you practice not knowing. This is harder than it sounds for someone who spent thirty years being paid to have answers at the tip of my tongue. The business stakeholders want to know why the new UI isn't pixel perfect. The accounting team wants to know when their GL batch job will be done. The sponsor wants an updated wave plan with clear assumptions documented - while everything is changing per their direction.

The silence says: you don't actually know yet. And that's okay.
This is not the same as incompetence. This is the difference between pretending certainty to maintain authority and admitting uncertainty to maintain integrity. Every project manager knows the gap between what the Gantt chart promises and what's actually possible. The silence teaches you to stop lying about it.
When I sit in morning silence, I practice acknowledging what I don't know:

Whether release IV will ship on time
If the scope is actually finalized or if we're heading toward late-stage requirements creep
What the collision between the other priority one schedule and our stand-ups is costing us in coordination overhead
Whether the person who went off on me in front of everyone will undermine the project enough to get me fired

I don't know. And for one hour, I don't pretend I do.

### Listening Instead of Fixing
Quaker worship is about listening. Not for instructions. Not for strategy. Just listening to what's actually present underneath the noise.
This translates directly to project management in ways that would never make it into a PMI certification course.
#### In stand-ups
I've stopped trying to solve every problem in real-time. When someone mentions a blocker, I listen first. Not to formulate my response, but to hear what they're actually saying underneath the technical language. Sometimes "I'm blocked on the PR merge" means "I'm confused about our architecture and don't want to admit it." Sometimes it means "I'm drowning and no one notices."

The silence teaches you to hear the difference.

#### In stakeholder meetings, 
I've stopped defending timelines I don't actually believe in. When Stephen asks about wave plans, I tell him what I know, what I'm uncertain about, and what assumptions we're working from. Then I shut up. The silence after an honest statement does more work than twelve slides of risk mitigation strategies. 

#### In planning sessions, 
I've learned to sit with the gaps. We have stories marked "ready for SIT" that aren't actually ready. We have backlog items without proper team tags. We have Sprint 8 carryover that nobody wants to name as carryover. The old me would have frantically reorganized everything to create the appearance of control. The new me sits with the mess long enough to see what it's actually telling us.
### The Practice of Showing Up
Here's what sitting in silence every morning has taught me about managing impossible projects: ### you show up anyway.
Not because you have it figured out. Not because you've documented all the risks and dependencies into a comprehensive mitigation strategy. You show up because showing up is the practice.

Some mornings I sit in silence and feel profound peace. Some mornings I mentally revise the wave plan for thirty minutes and accomplish nothing spiritual whatsoever. Some mornings I cry because I'm fifty-six years old, finally medicated for ADHD I've had my entire life, and I'm grieving thirty years of working twice as hard as everyone else without knowing why.
Then I get up. I facilitate the stand-up. I update Monday.com. I clarify discrepancies. I ensure stories are properly tagged. I sit in meetings with people who have no idea I spent the first hour of my day practicing surrender.
The silence doesn't make the project easier. It makes me more honest about how hard it actually is.

### What This Looks Like in Practice
#### Before silence: 
I would walk into a meeting with twelve strategies for twelve potential problems, ready to demonstrate competence through preparedness.
#### After silence: 
I walk into meetings with curiosity about what's actually happening and willingness to say "I don't know, let's find out together."
#### Before silence: 
I took every project setback as evidence of my failure as a PM.
#### After silence: 
I recognize that I inherited a legacy system conversion with problems that predate my six weeks on the project, and my job is to steward it forward, not to have prevented its entire history.
#### Before silence: 
When someone questioned my approach publicly, I would defend, justify, framework it into something manageable.
#### After silence: 
I sat with the humiliation and fear, acknowledged I can't control her perception, and kept doing the work anyway.
#### Before silence: 
I believed my value came from having answers.
#### After silence: 
I know my value comes from showing up when I don't.

### The Serenity Prayer for Project Managers
I say the serenity prayer a lot these days. It's a 12-step thing, but it works for project management:

God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.

#### I cannot change that this project was a mess before I arrived. I can document assumptions clearly.
#### I cannot change that key people get pulled into ops meetings during stand-ups. I can address meeting conflicts directly.
#### I cannot change that someone with less experience questioned my competence publicly. I can keep showing up with integrity.
#### I cannot change that I'm fifty-six in a market that doesn't want me, managing a project that might fail despite my best efforts. I can sit in silence every morning and practice surrender.
The silence doesn't give me control. It teaches me I never had it. And somehow, that's enough.

### Bottom Line
Every morning at 5:47 AM, I practice leading nothing. No agenda. No stakeholders. No action items. Just sitting in silence, waiting for something I cannot manage into existence. Then I get up and manage a multi-workstream legacy system conversion with inherited problems and distributed dependencies and all the chaos that thirty years in IT has taught me to expect. The silence doesn't make me a better project manager in any measurable way. It makes me a more honest one. And in a field built on the beautiful lie that we can control complex systems through superior methodology, honesty might be the most radical practice available.
So go it.
