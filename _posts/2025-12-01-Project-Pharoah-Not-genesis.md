# Not Genesis, but Pharaoh

The executive order dropped November 24, 2025. I counted. "Accelerate" appears eight times. "Security" seventeen times. "Rest" zero. "Wisdom" zero.
They called it Genesis.

There's an American lie that works by telling truth badly. Take a sacred word—one that's meant something for three thousand years—and attach it to its opposite. 

Wait a while or even a generation. People forget. The word becomes a brand, like Odyssey for a minivan. The forgetting is the point.

Here's what the order says. Establish the "American Science and Security Platform." Integrate all DOE supercomputers. Harness—their word—federal datasets. Create AI agents to automate research. Do it in 60, 90, 120, 270 days. No pause. No discernment. Only acceleration.

In the actual Genesis, God calls things into being. Speaks light into existence. Invites. This Genesis seizes. Harnesses. Dominates. No calling forth—only taking hold.

Same months: $18 billion cut from NIH. NSF slashed 55 percent. Graduate fellowships halved. Division of Equity for Excellence in STEM—eliminated, staff fired. Research Experiences for Undergraduates—cut 75 percent. A thousand grants killed. The pipeline that makes American scientists—severed. Universities aren't being called forth to create something good. They're being starved into compliance. Make bricks without straw. This isn't creation. It's Pharaoh.

Pharaoh builds monuments. Pharaoh extracts labor. Pharaoh consolidates power and calls it glory. Same structure here. Destroy distributed research. Seize the remains into the federal platform. Starve the workers. Build the monument.
They say we must beat China. Then destroy the workforce that would run the race. Incoherent—unless scientific leadership was never the goal. 

Defund universities into dependence. Kill independent grants. Build a unified platform under executive control. Frame it as security. 

## Call it Genesis.
When "Genesis" means arms race, what word remains for actual creation? "Security" seventeen times, "wisdom" never—what have we admitted? The corruption isn't just political. It's spiritual. It hollows us out.
Not building. Extracting. Not calling forth. Enslaving. Calling it Genesis while making bricks without straw.

### The word isn't Genesis. It's Pharaoh.
