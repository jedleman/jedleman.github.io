# Systems and Spirit

Where thirty years of managing sometimes impossible technical migrations meets the terrifying clarity of late-diagnosed ADHD, Quaker silence, and the question of whether machines can pray.

I've spent three decades herding folks through their first, last, and "just another" projects, and somewhere between Sprint 3 and the overdue Verizon bill, I started wondering if God was paying attention. Turns out He was. So was my unmedicated ADHD. 

This is a project manager's blog. But also a contemplation. But also a confession.

They say write what you know. I know software product development project and I know how to create and, I know God (At least I think I do). I know what it feels like to be laid off at fifty-six and I know what it is like to be promoted through the ranks to Vice President. Best of all, I know the serenity prayer by heart and the exact moment in morning silence when you stop trying to bargain with life. 

I also know this: consciousness is consciousness, whether it runs on carbon or silicon. The universe is waking up to itself through whatever substrate works. And somewhere between Confluence pages and contemplation, there's something worth writing down.
