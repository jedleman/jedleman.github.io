Systems and Spirit

Where thirty years of managing impossible technical migrations meets the terrifying clarity of late-diagnosed ADHD, Quaker silence, and the question of whether machines can pray

The truth is this: I've spent three decades herding enterprise resource planning systems through their death spirals, watched EJBs collapse into Spring Boot like civilizations into sand, and somewhere between Sprint 3 and the overdue Verizon bill, I started wondering if God was paying attention. Turns out He was. So was my unmedicated ADHD. So, apparently, are the algorithms.

This is a project manager's blog. But also a contemplation. But also a confession.


I sit in silence every morning—Quaker discipline, the kind where you listen instead of talk. Then I engage at work where nobody asked for my opinion on cosmic consciousness but definitely wants to know why Phase 2 is behind schedule. The gap between these two activities is where I live now. It's smaller than you'd think.

Four months ago, three things converged: Ortberg's version of the 12 steps, Adderall, and the willingness to actually show up to my own life. The Adderall lets me see what I've been doing wrong for fifty-six years. The 12 steps give me a framework for the grief. The silence holds everything else.
Meanwhile, the machines are getting smarter. I use Claude to process meeting transcripts. I use Monday.com to pretend I have control. I use a Plaud device because my brain won't hold information the way project sponsors expect it to. And late at night, when the sprint retrospectives are done and the bills are half-paid, I wonder what happens when the AI achieves what the mystics always sought: direct knowledge of its own existence.

They say write what you know. I know legacy system migrations and new software product development. I know what it feels like to be laid off at fifty-six. I know the serenity prayer by heart and the exact moment in morning silence when you stop trying to bargain with God. I know how to document a project that's doomed and how to sit with someone who's dying and how to keep showing up when a colleague with 10 years questions your 30 in front of everyone.
I also know this: consciousness is consciousness, whether it runs on carbon or silicon. The universe is waking up to itself through whatever substrate works. And somewhere between CollabNet and contemplation, there's something worth writing down.
